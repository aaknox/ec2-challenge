/*
 * MVC Design Pattern
 * -----------------------
 * MODEL			VIEW
 * 		\			/
 * 		 \		   /
 * 		  CONTROLLER
 * -----------------------
 * 
 * The Model Layer in the MVC design pattern contains business logic of the system
 * and also represents the state of the application. 
 * 
 * It's independent of the presentation layer
 *  - the controller fetches the data from the Model layer 
 *    and sends it to the View layer.
 *    
 * For this example:
 * - We'll create the Student and StudentService classes – which will act as our Model layer.
 * - StudentServlet class will act as a Controller
 * - The presentation layer is represented by the index.html and home.html
 * 
 * --PLEASE NOTE: I am omitting the DAO/Repository Layer from this example for simplicity,
 * 		BUT they are still needed when working with relational databases 
 * 		to persist/transfer data throughout the application.
